#After you have scaled an image too much it looks blocky. One way of 
#reducing the blockiness of the image is to replace each pixel witht the
#average values of the pixels around it. this has the effect of smoothing
#out the changes in coor. Write a function that takes an image as a
#parameter and smooths the image. Your function should return a new image
#that is the same as the old but smoothed.
